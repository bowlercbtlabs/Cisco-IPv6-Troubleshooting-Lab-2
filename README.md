# Cisco IPv6 Troubleshooting - Lab 2

## Trouble Ticket #1

### Problem
- Your Company is implementing an IPv6 EIGRP Network Design. One of your junior level technicians has come to you for help. He is having problems bringing up the EIGRP Adjacency between R2 and R1.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that R2 and R1 form an EIGRP neighbor adjacency.

## Trouble Ticket #2

### Problem
- After connectivity was restored between R2 and R1 you realize that there is another problem, the EIGRP adjacency between R1 and R3 is not coming up as well.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that R1 and R3 form an EIGRP neighbor adjacency.
- Once the neighbor relationship is restored, you should be able to ping from R2’s loopback 0 interface (2001:2:2:2::2) to R3’s loopback 0 interface (2001:3:3:3::3) with 100% Success.
- Do not remove any commands from any Router to complete this task
